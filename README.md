A personal recipe vault

----

Cokhot is a cooking application developed with Blazor. It allows you to store all your recipes, rate them, and organize them easily. Whether you are an experienced chef or a beginner, Cokhot makes managing your recipes simple.

## Features

- Add new recipes with details (ingredients, instructions, etc.).

- Categorize recipes by type (starter, main course, dessert, etc.).

- Rate recipes to save your preferences.

- Search recipes by name or category.

- Later we'll add more functionnalities such as list of drinks, restaurants etc.

The goal is to make it simple, so you can catalog your recipes, remember/keep a trace or just to find inspiration when youâ€™re out of ideas.
